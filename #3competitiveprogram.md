## INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT  
In this project,To make the competitive programming contests explain easier for participants by providing a context-specific boilerplate code for problems  
## HOW TO HELP TOOLS  
### 1.Input and output  
* In a competitive programming contests,the participants write an online coding plateform. So the submitted of an project contains some negative marks of an wrong submit.  
* the script tools used to defines a files format to get an input and output.  
* This tools are used to verify the input and output to particular programs. So easily identify your program status.  
### 2. To support for various types of problems  
* If the program contains large number of input or arrays,the participants store the input in file format tools,it used to manage time to participants.  
* The input values are store once on file format tools,then save the time to gives compiler.  
* The input values are stable to store the files,it help to give correct input values.  
### 3.Comparison of actual and expected output in tools  
* The file format input and output files,to add the expected output files that help to compare an online output as well as expected output using script tools  
* It help to save time and works from the participants.   
### 4.Improved user experience  
* In contests programming,the script tools are very useful to perform participants.  
* It gives time management and working process also reduced.  
* Participants check output without submitions.  
### 5.Reduce the complexity  
* Online contests contains various platform to the managements  
* The scripting tools are useful to the all platforms.  
* It reduce the complexity of participants.
