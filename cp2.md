### Can list out the various parts of the tool and explain how they interact with one another.
### Parts Of The Tool
1. ## Install the Package & Extensions
  * Install  the programmimg languages package or  extension for the  execution of the program.
  * As per user selection of the programming languages.
  * Then it easy for the user to choose the program.
  * In program we use inbuilt syntax,header to display on the coding interface . 
  * we write script for the template of the programming language.

 ## Create Foldes for Projects
   * To create folders and subfolders of the projects.
   * Easy to use for the participants.
## WebScraping Techniques.
* Using web scraping  technique to parse the contest easily.
* Other tecniques using browser extension to write the script  and automate the contest easily.
## Script for I/O redirection.
* Using input /output redirection technique to parse the input, output.
* Easy to use to write a script.
## Logic code
* Main part of the logic code only we  inside the programming template 
## Testcase Comparison
* compare the test case with actual,expected using script (T**o write how to compare testcase using any of the  logic code.)** to Automate them.
## Reduced complexity
 **These are the above steps used to reduce the  complexity.**
 **Then using any one of the algorithm to compute score of the board and upadate the winners.**
## Improve UX
 * Improve the user experience for all participants
 * Easy to use 
* Well documnented provide
