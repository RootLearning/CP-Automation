# Competitive Programming - Automation

Project to generate context specific boilerplate code for problem solving in contests/online platforms.

* Should provide options for file locations - Input and Output.
* Should provide support for various types of problems - boilerplate code to differ based on problem type.
* Integration with APIs for fetching and preloading test cases is recommended.
* Comparison of actual output with that of expected output will be helpful - Think of the best UX to do this.
* Improved User Experience is the goal here. 
* Should reduce the complexity of participating in online contests.
